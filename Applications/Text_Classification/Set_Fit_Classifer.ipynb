    "## **SetFit: Efficient Few-Shot Learning for Sentence Transformers**\n",
    "\n",
    "`SetFit` is a framework designed to enable efficient few-shot learning for [`Sentence Transformers`](https://sbert.net/)\n",
    "\n",
    "It achieves high accuracy with little labeled data - for instance, with only 8 labeled examples per class on the Customer Reviews sentiment dataset, 🤗 SetFit is competitive with fine-tuning `RoBERTa` Large on the full training set of 3k examples!\n",
    "\n",
    "### **What is `Few-Shot Learning`?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Few-shot learning refers to the ability of a model to generalize and perform well on new tasks with only a small number of labeled examples. This is particularly useful in scenarios where obtaining large amounts of labeled data is impractical or expensive.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **What is `Zero-Shot Learning`?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Zero-shot learning is a related concept where a model can make predictions on tasks it has never seen before, without any labeled examples. This is typically achieved by leveraging knowledge learned from other tasks or datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **What is `Sentence Transformers`?**\n",
    "\n",
    "`Sentence Transformers` is a framework that allows you to easily compute dense vector representations or `Word Embeddings` for sentences and paragraphs. These embeddings can then be used for various NLP tasks such as semantic search, clustering, and classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Key Features of SetFit:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Efficiency**: SetFit is designed to be computationally efficient, making it suitable for scenarios with limited resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Few-Shot Learning**: It excels in few-shot learning scenarios, requiring only a small number of labeled examples to achieve high accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Versatility**: SetFit can be applied to a wide range of NLP tasks, including sentiment analysis, topic classification, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **How SetFit Works:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Pre-trained Sentence Transformer**: `SetFit` starts with a pre-trained `Sentence Transformer` model that has been trained on a large corpus of text data.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Few-Shot Fine-Tuning**: The model is then fine-tuned using a small number of `labeled` examples specific to the target task. This fine-tuning process allows the model to adapt to the new task while retaining its general language understanding capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Evaluation**: After fine-tuning, the model is evaluated on a validation set to assess its performance on the target task.\n",

    "We will be using `Hugging Face's` `transformers` and `datasets` libraries to demonstrate how to use `SetFit` for few-shot learning.\n",

    "## **Getting Started with `SetFit`**\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we begin, ensure you have the necessary libraries installed. You can install them using pip:\n",

    "pip install transformers datasets setfit\n",
